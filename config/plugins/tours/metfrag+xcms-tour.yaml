      Metabolite identification is a crucial step when trying to understand e.g.
      the courses of a disease on the metabolomic level.  In this tour we will
      demonstrate the MetFrag workflow, which goes a first step to annotate
      molecules from compound (metabolite) databases  to MS/MS (tandem mass
      spectrometry) spectra. This annotation is based on the mapping of in
      silico generated fragments to the experimental spectra  and scoring of
      your arrow keys and leave the tour at any time point with 'Escape' or the
      'End tour' button.
