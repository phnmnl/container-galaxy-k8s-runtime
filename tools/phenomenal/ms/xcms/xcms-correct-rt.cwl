  To correct differences between retention times between different samples, a
  number of of methods exist in XCMS. retcor is the generic method. The module
  gets XCMS-Set objects which was grouped together by **xcms-collect-peaks**

# | Method  | Description                                                                                                             |

# | loess   | Fit a polynomial surface determined by one or more numerical predictors, using local fitting.                           |
# +---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
# | obiwarp | Calculate retention time deviations for each sample. It is based on the code at http://obi-warp.sourceforge.net/.       |
# |         | However, this function is able to align multiple samples, by a center-star strategy.                                    |
