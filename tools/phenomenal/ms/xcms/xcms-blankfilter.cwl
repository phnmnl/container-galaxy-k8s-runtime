      rdata containing a grouped xcmsSet. This xcmsSet should contain dilution
      samples as well as real samples. The phenotype (class) of the samples
      should also be set using for example find-peaks. Althought there are many
      ways of generating the rdata file, the most straightforward pipline
      can for example be like xcms-findpeaks->collect->xcms-group->xcms-retcor->dilutionfilter.
