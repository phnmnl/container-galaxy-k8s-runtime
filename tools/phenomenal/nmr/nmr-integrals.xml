---------------------
Short Description
---------------------

Compares specific metabolite levels in two NMR spectra of blood serum/plasma samples.

---------------
Description
---------------

This tool implements a comparison between the NMR spectra of a reference sample
and a test sample, based on selected metabolite signals.

Two aliquots of the same sample have the same metabolomic profiles, and thus
have exactly the same NMR spectra. Based on this premise, the NMR spectrum can
be used to check the quality of samples. This tool compares the NMR
spectrum a blood serum/plasma sample with the NMR spectrum of a different
aliquot of the same sample acquired at a different time (e.g., spectrum
acquired at the moment of the sample collection vs. spectrum acquired after
long-term storage).  The metabolites tested are those one that were
experimentally identified as "sensible" indicators of sample quality. The
respective NMR signals are selected, and their relative concentrations inside
each of the sample compared are measured. Spectral total area is also calculated
to have information about the presence of contaminations.

The operation is part of a QC procedure for biobanks, where samples are
periodically analyzed to detected and measure long-term quality decay.

The tool generates a table and a set of plots indicating the signal differences
and whether they are significant.


-------
Input
-------


Left
  Left margin of the integration range (ppm value)

Right
  Right margin of the integration range (ppm value) (must be greater than left)

Where
  ppm value (inside the integration rage) where we want to align the signals of the two spectra.

Reference spectrum
  Bruker monodimensional 1H cpmg NMR spectrum

Test spectrum
  Bruker monodimensional 1H cpmg NMR spectrum

Signal Metabolites
  Optional table of signal metabolites, to override default behaviour.


+++++++++++++++++++
Metabolites table
+++++++++++++++++++

The metabolites table specifies, for each selected metabolite, an integration
window for one or more of its signals inside the spectra.  The program will by
default use a table (shown below) made specifically for the purpose of detecting
decay of blood serum/plasma samples.  You may however customize this table to
apply the technique to other types of samples.


Here is the table format.

Columns:

1st column
  Metabolite name

2nd column
  Right margin of the integration range (ppm value)

3rd column
  Left margin of the integration range (ppm value)

4th column
  ppm value (inside the integration rage) where we want to align the signals of the two spectra.

5th column
  base line correction (0: no /1: yes)

6th column
  signal alignment at where (0: no /1: yes)



The table below is the *default table*, which has been verified to return sensible
values:

1. Plots of ppm vs relative intensity, for each metabolite (PDF format).
2. Table (tab-separated columns) with the difference in the relative
concentration of the selected metabolites. Threshold: +/-20%.



Table columns:

1st column
  Metabolite name

2nd column
  ok/bad

4th column
